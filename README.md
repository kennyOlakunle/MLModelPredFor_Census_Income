# Machine Learning prediction for Census Income Using different ML models
## Objective
In this exercise, we use the US Census dataset from the Census bureau (publicly available from UCI Machine Learning Repository). 
The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year or not based on a number of attributes.
After prediction, models are optimised, evaluated and models results are compared as: How optimisation improves the performance of the model? Which parameters were used for optimisation?
and how the accuracies of the models can be compared after optimizations.
