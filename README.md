# Machine Learning prediction for Census Income Using different ML models (Classification, Clustering, Neural Network)
## Objective
In this exercise, we use the US Census dataset from the Census bureau (publicly available from UCI Machine Learning Repository). 
The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50,000 a year or not based on a number of attributes.
After prediction, models shoiuld be optimised, evaluated and are compared as: How optimisation improves the performance of the model? Which parameters were used for optimisation?
and how the accuracy of the models can be compared after optimizations.

# Dataset Variables

The dataset has 14 column names as below:

• age: the age of an individual 

• workclass: employment status of an individual 

• fnlwgt: final weight. In other words, this is the number of people the census believes the entry 
represents

• education: the highest level of education achieved by an individual

• education-num: the highest level of education achieved in numerical form

• marital-status: marital status of an individual. 

• occupation: the general type of occupation of an individual 

• relationship: represents what this individual is relative to others

• sex: the biological sex of the individual 

• capital-gain: capital gains for an individual 

• capital-loss: capital loss for an individual 

• hours-per-week: the hours an individual has reported to work per week 

• native-country: country of origin for an individual 

• label: whether or not an individual makes more than $50,000 annually.
